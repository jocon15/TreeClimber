# Tree Climber

Tree Climber is a Blazor Server application that lets you manipulate your JSON files in an expaning binary tree format.

Text editors allow you to edit raw JSON, but it lacks the robust features that you need to manipulate your JSON data.

With Tree Climber, we present the JSON in an expaning tree view and provide a robust feature set for you to edit you JSON quick and easy.



#### Copy and Paste

Current text editors allow you to copy and paste JSON structures, but you may run into issues of formatting and making sure you have those pesky commas after each element. With Tree Climber's copy from exisitng element, you can perform the same operation but without all the formatting headache.
